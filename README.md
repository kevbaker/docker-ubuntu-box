# Docker Ubuntu Box

This sets up Docker to provide a simple Ubuntu box access from command line in the host OS. The idea is quickly host over, test various services and provide a passthrough for commands to Linux from the host OS via `docker exec`.

## Setup

* Checkout project
* Run `npm run docker:build`
* Run `npm run docker:shell`
* RUn `npm run docker:whoami`
